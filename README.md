# beta-ios

This is my submission for the Beta - Mobile App Developer coding challenge.

To run this app, you must have Xcode installed on your machine and download the files in this repo.
1. Open Xcode
2. Open the `weather.xcodeproj` file
3. Choose a simulator to run the app on (ex: iPhone 13 Pro, etc.)
4. Run the app (Cmd + R) (Note: you must allow location permissions to get weather data)
6. Enjoy!
