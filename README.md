# beta-ios

This is my submission for the Beta - Mobile App Developer coding challenge.

To run this app, you must have an up-to-date Xcode installed on your machine, download the files in this repo, and follow these steps:
1. Open Xcode
2. Open the `weather.xcodeproj` file
3. Choose a simulator to run the app on (ex: iPhone 13 Pro, etc.)
4. Run the app (Cmd + R)
  * Note: You must set the location of your simulator in Xcode (found at the top of the console)
